# AI-Weather-Forecaster
To use the model:

1. Download the two files, the WeatherForecaster5.ipynb and the NYCDataset.csv.
2. Open the WeatherForecaster5 model in GoogleColab or any program of your choice. I also left a .py file if you want that.
3. Upload the NYCDataset.csv file to the files folder. You only need to hit the upload button. You'll see it on the left side. Keep the file where it is.
   If you get an error, check if the file is in the correct path. You can change the path using the csv_path code in the WeatherForecaster5 code if you need to.
4. Once both the code and the dataset are loaded, hit run, and you'll get the results below after the model is finished running.
